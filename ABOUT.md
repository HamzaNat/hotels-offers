I've built the application with Java and Spring Boot. I went with Java because I'm familiar with it and picked Spring framework because I wanted to learn it (this is my first Spring application).

I wanted to build an application that it's maintainable and testable (and does its work for sure) by separating conerns. I decided to go with some MVC framework because of its inherit support to separation of concerns. My thought process was trying to mine concepts and make sure that they are valid generlizations by thinking about some way to implement them if some non-trivial change occured (like fetching data from database instead of Web API).

**Experience I have with**
* Java: advanced
* Spring: absoulte begginer
